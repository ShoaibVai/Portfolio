/* This file contains placeholder information to create or modify sound files.
   In a real implementation, you would need to create actual sound files
   for the portfolio. Below are descriptions of what each sound should be. */

/*
Required Sound Effects:
1. button-click.mp3 - Short, satisfying click sound for buttons (8-bit style)
2. hover.mp3 - Subtle hover sound for interactive elements (quieter than click)
3. start.mp3 - Impactful start game sound effect when pressing "Start"
4. achievement.mp3 - Celebratory sound when interacting with achievements
5. transition.mp3 - Whoosh or slide sound for section transitions

// Since we can't create actual sound files through this interface,
// you'll need to create or source these sound effects and place them in the assets/sounds directory.
