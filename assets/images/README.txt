// Since we can't create actual image files through this interface,
// you'll need to create or source these images and place them in the assets/images directory.
// You can use tools like Piskel (https://www.piskelapp.com/) for pixel art
// or source free game assets from sites like itch.io or OpenGameArt.org.
